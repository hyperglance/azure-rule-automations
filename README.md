# Hyperglance Rule Automations for Azure

> Enable Hyperglance to automate, fix and optimize your cloud.

This repository contains terraform configurations, that deploy a Azure storage account and App Function that you connect with your Hyperglance Instance. Giving you the power to automate your cloud and fix configuration issues quickly & easily.

## Pre-Requisites

Before you can deploy automations you will need:
1. Terraform CLI - [Install instructions](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
2. Azure CLI - [Install instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
3. Func CLI - [Install instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)

### Azure role assignments

This deployment utilizes system assigned managed identities to limit the scope of the Azure function to the subscription it is deployed in. 

To [assign Azure roles to a managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-managed-identity), you must have:

* Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write permissions

## Quick Start

1. Follow the pre-requisite steps above.
2. Connect the Azure CLI to the Azure account that you wish to deploy the function in and set the subscription to use: `az login`

	__Note:__ Guidance on authenticating to Azure can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli)
	
	Example:
	```bash
	$ az login
	$ az account set --subscription <subscription name>
	```

3. Clone our repo or  [download the zip](https://github.com/hyperglance/azure-rule-automations/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
	```bash
	$ git clone https://github.com/hyperglance/azure-rule-automations.git
	```

4. Deploy the stack:
	> Terraform will prompt for the region you wish to deploy to and for final confirmation.
	```bash
	$ cd azure-rule-automations/deployment/terraform/automations
	$ terraform init
	$ terraform apply
	```

5. Once complete, the storage account ID and  will be returned:
	```bash
	Apply complete! Resources: 11 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

	Outputs:

    func_command = "func azure functionapp publish hyperglance-automations-legible-buffalo"
    storage_account_resource_id = "/subscriptions/<subscription ID>/resourceGroups/hyperglance-automations-legible-buffalo/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/rii5it09y343"
	```
 
   *The storage account ID is required to configure automations in Hyperglance*
   *The func command is required to deploy the function code to the Azure function*
	
	Copy the storage account ID into the Hyperglance UI:  __Settings ➔ Automations ➔ Azure ➔ Storage Account Resource ID__
	or visit this URL: https://your-hyperglance-ip/#/admin/automations

6. Deploy the function code to the function
    
    __Note:__ We're working on integrating this step into the Terraform deployment...

    Change directory to the root of the repo and execute the func command generated by Terraform:

	```bash
    $ cd azure-rule-automations
	$ func azure functionapp publish hyperglance-automations-legible-buffalo
	```

7. __That's it - Automations are now enabled against this subscription!__
	* Within Hyperglance click on any rule or visit the Advanced Search page to start exploring automations features.
